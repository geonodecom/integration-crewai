21 CrewAI tools that let your agents read web pages through the [Geonode Scraper API](https://geonode.com/products/scraper-api): extract a page as Markdown or HTML, run batches and crawls, map a site's URLs, search the web and check usage. Package: [`geonode-scraper-crewai` on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geonode-scraper-crewai/).

## Before you start

- Python 3.10 or newer.
- A Geonode API key. Sign in to the [Geonode dashboard](https://app.geonode.com/), open **API Keys**, and create a key or copy an existing one.
- A language model for your agents. CrewAI reads the provider's key from the environment, for example `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

## Install

```sh
pip install geonode-scraper-crewai
```

This installs CrewAI and the shared [`geonode-scraper-tools-core`](https://pypi.org/project/geonode-scraper-tools-core/). CrewAI needs an extra for some model providers; for the Anthropic model in the example below, also run `pip install "crewai[anthropic]"`.

## Configure

Set `GEONODE_SCRAPER_API_KEY` to your Geonode key. For the agent example, set `CREWAI_MODEL` to a model supported by your installed framework and configure its provider credentials separately. The direct-tool example does not require a model.

```python
import os

from geonode_scraper_crewai import build_crewai_tools
from geonode_scraper_tools_core import ScraperToolSettings

settings = ScraperToolSettings(
    host="https://scraper.geonode.io",
    api_key=os.environ["GEONODE_SCRAPER_API_KEY"],
)
tools = build_crewai_tools(settings=settings)
```

`host` and `api_key` are required. The other settings have defaults:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `request_timeout` | none | Seconds to wait for each HTTP response. |
| `max_retries` | `0` | Extra attempts after a failed request. |
| `retry_backoff_seconds` | `1.0` | Pause before the first retry. |
| `poll_interval_seconds` | `3.0` | How often the `wait_for_*` tools check a job. |
| `poll_timeout_seconds` | `60.0` | How long the `wait_for_*` tools wait before giving up. |
| `verify_ssl` | `True` | Check TLS certificates. |

## Give the tools to an agent

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task

researcher = Agent(
    role="Web researcher",
    goal="Read web pages and report what they say",
    backstory="You read sources carefully and quote them accurately.",
    tools=tools,
    llm=os.environ["CREWAI_MODEL"],
)
task = Task(
    description="Read https://example.com and say in one sentence what the page is for.",
    expected_output="One sentence.",
    agent=researcher,
)
print(Crew(agents=[researcher], tasks=[task]).kickoff())
```

Any model CrewAI supports works in place of `llm`. The agent chooses which tools to call. For this task, `scraper_extract_content` provides the page Markdown; the exact tool calls depend on your model.

## Call a tool directly

Every tool is a regular CrewAI tool, so you can call it without an agent, for example in a test:

```python
extract = next(t for t in tools if t.name == "scraper_extract_content")
outcome = extract.run(url="https://example.com", formats=["markdown"])
if outcome["ok"]:
    print(outcome["result"]["data"]["markdown"])
else:
    print(outcome["error"]["status"], outcome["error"]["message"])
```

## What a tool returns

Tools don't raise on API errors. They return a dict, so the agent can read what went wrong and decide what to do:

- On success: `{"ok": true, "operation": "...", "attempts": 1, "result": {...}}`.
- On failure: `{"ok": false, "operation": "...", "attempts": 1, "error": {"status": 429, "code": "...", "message": "...", "retryable": true, ...}}`.

`status` is the API's HTTP status; the [Python SDK page](https://pypi.org/project/geonode-scraper-sdk/) lists what each one means. `retryable` says whether trying again can help.

## Pick only the tools you need

Fewer tools make it easier for a model to choose. Pass the operation names you want:

```python
tools = build_crewai_tools(settings=settings, operations=["extract", "map_urls", "search"])
```

| Operation | Tool | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `extract` | `scraper_extract_content` | Extract one URL as Markdown or HTML, now or as a background job. |
| `get_job_result` | `scraper_get_job_result` | Get the state or result of a background extraction. |
| `wait_for_job` | `scraper_wait_for_job` | Wait until a background extraction finishes. |
| `list_jobs` | `scraper_list_jobs` | List earlier extractions. |
| `create_batch` | `scraper_create_batch` | Start one job for many URLs. |
| `get_batch_status` | `scraper_get_batch_status` | Get a batch's progress and results so far. |
| `wait_for_batch` | `scraper_wait_for_batch` | Wait until a batch finishes. |
| `list_batch_jobs` | `scraper_list_batch_jobs` | List earlier batches. |
| `create_crawl` | `scraper_create_crawl` | Start a crawl from one URL. |
| `get_crawl_status` | `scraper_get_crawl_status` | Get a crawl's progress and pages so far. |
| `wait_for_crawl` | `scraper_wait_for_crawl` | Wait until a crawl finishes. |
| `list_crawl_jobs` | `scraper_list_crawl_jobs` | List earlier crawls. |
| `map_urls` | `scraper_map_urls` | Find the URLs under a site from its sitemap and links. |
| `list_map_jobs` | `scraper_list_map_jobs` | List earlier map runs. |
| `get_map_job` | `scraper_get_map_job` | Get one map run with its URLs. |
| `search` | `scraper_search` | Search the web and return ranked results. |
| `list_search_jobs` | `scraper_list_search_jobs` | List earlier searches. |
| `get_search_job` | `scraper_get_search_job` | Get one search with its results. |
| `get_statistics` | `scraper_get_statistics` | Usage statistics for a period. |
| `get_concurrency_usage` | `scraper_get_concurrency_usage` | Concurrent requests in use against the plan limit. |
| `health_check` | `scraper_check_health` | Check that the API is up. |

## Versions and support

- The latest version is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geonode-scraper-crewai/). The same tools are available for [LangChain](https://pypi.org/project/geonode-scraper-langchain/).
- Requests send `User-Agent: geonode-crewai/<version>`, which helps support see which version you use.
- Questions or problems: [contact Geonode](https://geonode.com/contact).
